An open world game, heavily inspired by The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild. This game replicates some elements from aforementioned game with my own creative design decision. The playable character has also been changed into a car, therefore game design as been built accustomed to that. Find the hidden shrines throughout this vast world to gain access to the last boss.

# Insights
It was a long time since I played a game as great as The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild. It inspired me to replicate the key elements of it. However, instead of creating a copy of the game, I decided to change the playable character into a car and adjust the key elements for it. Hence where the game project's title came from (What If Zelda Was A Car, where a common misconception is that Zelda is the name of the protagonist). I wanted to build a big world and compensate for the some things that lacked in the original game. As a car, I figured it should be much easier to traverse. Abilites which were present in the original has been are more about different way of traversing than objects interacting with each other.
